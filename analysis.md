# Wallet Credit Score Analysis

---

## Score Distribution Overview

After calculating credit scores for all wallets based on their Aave V2 transaction behavior, we analyzed the distribution of wallet scores across the 0-1000 scale, segmented into the following score ranges:

- **0-100**: 32 wallets  
- **100-200**: 49 wallets  
- **200-300**: 379 wallets  
- **300-400**: 29 wallets  
- **400-500**: 116 wallets  
- **500-600**: 233 wallets  
- **600-700**: 87 wallets  
- **700-800**: 1831 wallets  
- **800-900**: 301 wallets  
- **900-1000**: 440 wallets

## Behavioral Analysis by Score Range

### ðŸ“‰ Wallets in the Lower Score Range (0-300)

Wallets scoring between 0 and 300 typically exhibit higher-risk behaviors or poor financial management on the Aave V2 protocol, including:

- **Frequent Liquidations:** Multiple `liquidationcall` events indicating loan defaults or failure to maintain collateral.
- **Low or Zero Repayment:** Borrowed funds remain largely unpaid, resulting in a low repay-to-borrow ratio and significant unpaid debt.
- **High Outstanding Borrowed Amount:** Substantial net borrow balance after repayments.
- **Brief Active Periods with Debt:** Rapid borrowing followed by inactivity, possibly reflecting speculative or abusive behavior.
- **Insufficient Deposits:** Deposits just enough to enable borrowing but inadequate to sustain healthy positions.

**Summary:** These wallets represent significant credit risk, with probable defaults and weak repayment discipline.

### ðŸ“ˆ Wallets in the Higher Score Range (700-1000)

High-scoring wallets (700 and above) demonstrate responsible and engaged use of Aave V2, characterized by:

- **Strong Repay-to-Borrow Ratios:** Frequently achieving full or over repayment, showing financial reliability.
- **Minimal or No Liquidations:** Effective collateral management to avoid forced position closures.
- **Timely and Consistent Repayments:** Maintaining good repayment cadence.
- **Substantial Deposits:** Acting as liquidity providers or committed users contributing to protocol stability.
- **Long-Term Engagement:** Sustained interaction over extended periods, reflecting trustworthiness.
- **Net Positive Deposits:** Contributing more liquidity than withdrawn.
- **Deposit-Only Behaviors:** Wallets that deposit without borrowing score very highly, posing low credit risk.

**Summary:** Wallets in this range are trusted users, promoting protocol health and reliability.

## Conclusion

This analysis of wallet credit scores highlights the broad spectrum of user behaviors on Aave V2. The score distribution shows a strong clustering of wallets in the 700-800 range, reflecting a majority of responsible users. Lower scoring wallets identify riskier participants whose behavior could threaten protocol security.

The credit scoring model provides a transparent and actionable risk metric to inform lending decisions, liquidity incentives, or further protocol governance considerations.

## How to Use This Analysis

- **Developers & Analysts:** Use score ranges to segment user populations and tailor risk mitigation strategies.
- **Risk Management:** Identify wallets with low scores for monitoring or intervention.
- **Community Governance:** Base incentive or penalty mechanisms on creditworthiness.
- **Further Research:** Analyze score evolution over time to study user behavior trends.
